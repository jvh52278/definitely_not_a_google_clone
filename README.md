# definitely_not_a_google_clone
I will attempt to make a clone of google:
<br>
the search engine
<br>
youtube
<br>
<br>
<br>
Required tools and dependencies:
<br>
Apache
<br>
PHP
<br>
Mysql
<br>
ffmpeg
<br>
mpstat
<br>
<br>
Developed and tested on ubuntu 24.04.
<br>
<br>
to get started, run the sql code in the file "not_youtube_sql_setup.txt" to setup the database
<br>
<br>
In the file "database_access_functions.php", at the bottom of the file, change the database access information to reflect your own database and user
<br>
<br>
There is also an admin user that will be created. The password to this user is "admin". It would be wise to change the password for this user.
