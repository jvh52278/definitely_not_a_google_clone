# definitely_not_a_google_clone
I will attempt to make a clone of google:
<br>
the search engine
<br>
youtube
<br>
email service
<br>
maps
<br>
<br>
Required tools and dependencies:
<br>
Apache -> using version 2.4.52
<br>
PHP -> using version 8.1.2
<br>
Mysql -> using version 8.0.33
<br>
ffmpeg -> using version 4.4.2
<br>
<br>
Developed and tested on ubuntu 22.04, but Linux is not required.
<br>
Tools and dependencies are also available on windows.
